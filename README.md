# Analysis of the King County Housing Market


## The Objective
Use Linear Regression to predict the sale price of a house in King County, WA, based on its features.

## The Motivation
The King County housing market is worth over $11bn annually, with 60 properties being sold every day. Being able to predict a propertyâ€™s value based on its characteristics allows a real estate consultancy to:
* Identify and invest in undervalued property
* Evaluate the profitability of renovation work done to properties
* Ensure that property is not sold below its intrinsic value

## The Technologies Used
* Pandas for Data Manipulation
* Matplotlib / Seaborn for Data Visualisation
* Statsmodels / Scikit Learn for Linear Regression

## The Process Overview
Having been provided with a dataset, we will need to inspect and clean it as required.
This will involve:
* Checking for (and potentially replacing) Null values
* Checking for outliers and removing as required
* Identifying and binning categorical values

The modelling process will then involve:
* Checking for multicollinearity, and removing features as required
* Transform data where required to encourage normal distributions of features
* Final selection of features
* Modelling using Scikit Learn

We should then verify our model using:
* Standard measures such as R-Squared
* Overfitting measures such as k-fold validation
